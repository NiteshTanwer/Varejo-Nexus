Varejo-Nexus: Operational Performance &amp; Logistics Intelligence.

Overview

This project provides a comprehensive operational audit of a major Brazilian multi-vendor marketplace. By architecting an end-to-end data pipeline—from BigQuery warehousing to R statistical cleaning and Tableau visualization—I transformed over 100,000 raw transactional records into actionable business intelligence. The analysis focuses on three core pillars: Logistics Efficiency, Seller Quality, and Market Demand Trends.

The Business Challenge

As the marketplace scaled, stakeholders faced three critical "blind spots":

Logistics Bottlenecks: Unclear visibility into regional "Reliability Penalties" for cross-state shipping.
Seller Performance: A lack of a standardized system to rank vendors based on both volume and customer satisfaction.
Growth Forecasting: Difficulty in tracking how seller density affects consumer freight costs over time.
